# LinuxOSXremap

## No Longer In Active Development

I have found a new way of accomplishing these goes with practically none of this effort. The Konsole editor made by the folks at KDE pretty well supports what I accomplished via scripting for the gnome-terminal, but with none of the overhead of the python scripting. I would strongly recommend users to look into using Konsole, the keymap file however may still be useful for correcting keymap issues, but it can also vary between devices and distros, so mileage will always vary on that.
## The Mission

Programmers should be focused on programming, not slowed down by superficial differences in an OS.

## Requirements
* Ubuntu 16.04?
* python2
* python3
* autocutsel (this will auto install)

## Features
* OSX/Lisp style keymaps
* OSX shortcuts for screenshot, while also retaining Ctrl-C termination behavior in bash
* OSX like auto copy for selected content in gnome-terminal

## Description

Remapping Linux, specifically just Ubuntu 16.04 for right now, to use OSX or Lisp style keymaps. The idea is to make all of my shortcut keys that I actually use on my OSX computers the exact same on Linux. It's a preference thing, some will like it and others won't care or understand the joys of not needing spider fingers.

This script requires python2 and python3. I have only tested this with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

## Planned features

Currently there are no other planned features. Some more testing needs to be done to make this script compatiable with other versions of ubuntu and/or compatiable with any DE, not just gnome. There are issues with using xkbcomp or xmodmap to accomplish the remap, so any requests to use either will be denied. If I use any method at all, that is more compatiable with any distro, it will be a modification to the x11org.conf file because it would not require 2 or more additional files and modifications to try and load and maintain it during a user session. There is a real bug that prevents the ability of keeping an xmodmap or xkbcomp in memory across a suspend, but only on the first login when using Ubuntu 16.04 and I am not sure how many other versions and distros that may affect

Other OSX and Linux users are welcomed and encouraged to submit their changes as well. I really do want to aim for keyboard parity with OSX on linux. If there are specific applications that are on both Linux and OSX with shortcuts that differ then I hope you will consider making an autokey file or something to help resolve that issue and submit it to me in a pull request. I will include it, even if it is just a comment under Issues I will review it and find a way to add those shortcuts, but only for that specific application.
